# Intelligent-Learning-Report-Generation-System
AI-powered system for automatic generation of structured assessment reports using OCR and CNN-based analysis.

ðŸ“– Project Overview

The Intelligent Learning Report Generation System is a Python-based AI platform designed to automatically extract handwritten marks from student answer sheets and generate structured Excel reports. The system leverages:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting handwritten marks from scanned answer sheets.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 testing images) for accurate digit recognition.

Predefined Regions of Interest (ROIs) tailored to our collegeâ€™s answer sheets, ensuring precise extraction of marks.

Excel report generation for seamless export and analysis of results.

Note: The system is customized for the first page of our collegeâ€™s semester answer booklets. Predefined ROIs are specific to these sheets.
